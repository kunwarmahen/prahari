"""Keeping the watch running: a systemd user unit for ``prahari serve``.

A watch looks only while ``prahari serve`` runs. Started in a terminal,
it stops when the terminal closes, the laptop restarts, or a Python
error takes it down -- and nothing says so until the person wonders why
the price drop they were waiting for never came. The fix is the
machine's own service manager, which starts it at login and starts it
again if it dies.

    prahari unit                 print the unit, change nothing
    prahari unit --install       write it, and the settings it needs

WHAT THE UNIT CANNOT SEE IS WRITTEN DOWN FOR IT. A service starts with
almost nothing in its environment: not the PATH a ``uv run`` needs, not
``PRAHARI_YANTRA`` saying which Yantra looks, not ``PRAHARI_DVARA_URL``
saying where news goes. ``--install`` copies every ``PRAHARI_*`` and
``YANTRA_*`` setting of the shell it is run from, and its PATH, into an
env file the unit reads. That file can hold tokens, so it is made
readable by its owner alone; the unit itself holds no setting, so it can
be shown and shared.

STARTING IT IS THE PERSON'S CALL. ``--install`` writes two files and
prints the ``systemctl --user`` lines that start it. It runs none of
them: a service that keeps running when you log out (``loginctl
enable-linger``) is a decision about your machine, not a side effect of
a command that writes a file.

Linux with systemd only. Elsewhere, ``prahari serve`` under whatever keeps
programs running there does the same job.
